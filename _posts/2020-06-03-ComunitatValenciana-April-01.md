### Report prepared on 2020-06-03

#### This report uses full genome sequence data for Comunitat Valenciana shared publicly by [Servicio de Microbiologia. Consorcio Hospital General Universitario de Valencia](https://www.icsa.es/en/clientes/hospital-general-servicio-de-microbiologia-valencia),  [Servicio de Microbiologia. Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valencia](http://clinicomalvarrosa.san.gva.es/ca/microbiologia),and [Sequencing and Bioinformatics Service and Molecular Epidemiology Research Group. FISABIO-Public Health](http://fisabio.san.gva.es/en/genomica-y-salud) and a set of international background sequences from [GISAID](http://www.epicov.org) ([laboratory acknowledgements](http://whoinfectedwhom.org/gisaid_cov2020_acknowledgement_table.xls))


## Key points
* We estimate a number of key epidemiological parameters for Comunitat Valenciana based on the genetic diversity of these samples alongside a set of closely related sequences from elsewhere which act as a global reservoir.
* In this preliminary analysis we estimate a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.16 in Comunitat Valenciana at the start of the epidemic with R(t) falling just below 1 at end of March.
* We estimate a moderately high reporting rate in Comunitat Valenciana (around 25%) with a median estimate from the phylodynamic model of 17,807 cases at the end of April compared to 5,413 reported cases at the same time point.



#### This analysis is based on : 
  
* **54 whole genomes** sampled from **within Comunitat Valenciana**
* **49 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **Comunitat Valenciana**
* Samples within Comunitat Valenciana were collected between **2020-02-27** and **2020-04-01**

Duplicate sequences were removed because they may represent infections associated with the same contact-traced transmission chain. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the included sequences over time, including external sequences. 

Reported cases for comparison to our model predictions are taken from the [BING Covid Tracker](https://bing.com/covid/local/valencia_spain?vert=graph). These data are used for comparison purposes and to estimate the reporting rate and do not influence the phylodynamic analysis.

## How many are infected in Comunitat Valenciana?
In this  analysis we estimate ** 17807 [6980-76264] ** median [95%CI] cumulative infections at the time of the the last sample (2020-04-28). At the same time point there were **5413** reported cases. The estimates follow a similar trajectory to the reported cases at a different magnitude.
