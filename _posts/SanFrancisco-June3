### Report prepared on 2020-06-03
#### This report uses full genome sequence data for Telangana shard publicly by [UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory](https://clinlab.ucsf.edu/ucsf-clinical-laboratories-online-manual) and [Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/) and a set of international background sequences from [GISAID](http://www.epicov.org) ([laboratory acknowledgements](http://whoinfectedwhom.org/gisaid_cov2020_acknowledgement_table.xls))



## Key points
* We estimate a number of key epidemiological parameters for San Francisco based on the genetic diversity of these samples alongside a set of closely related sequences from elsewhere which act as a global reservoir.
* In this preliminary analysis we estimate a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.04 in San Francisco at the start of the epidemic with R(t) falling below 1 at the beginning of April.
* We estimate a low reporting rate in San Francisco (below 5%) with a median estimate from the phylodynamic model of 50,030 cases at the end of April compared to 1647 reported cases at the same time point.




#### This is analysis is based on : 
  
* **50 whole genomes** sampled from **within San Francisco**
* **47 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **San Francisco**
* Samples within San Francisco were collected between **2020-03-05** and **2020-04-30**

## How many are infected in San Francisco?
In this  analysis we estimate **50030 [10273-229885] ** median [95%CI] cumulative infections at the time of the the last sample (2020-04-28). At the same time point there were **1647** reported cases. The estimates follow a similar trajectory to the reported cases at a different magnitude.

## How quickly has the epidemic in San Francisco grown?




| Quantile | Reproduction number | Growth rate (per day) | Doubling time (days) |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
|   50%    |        2.04         |         0.108         |         6.43         |
|   2.5%   |        1.75         |        0.0809         |         4.87         |
