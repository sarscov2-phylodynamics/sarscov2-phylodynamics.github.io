### Report prepared on 2020-06-02
#### This report uses full genome sequence data for Portugal shared publicly by [Centro Hospitalar Vila Nove de Gaia Espinho](https://www.chvng.pt/),  [Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa](https://www.chvng.pt/),   [Hospital de Santarem](https://www.hds.min-saude.pt/) and [Instituto Nacional de Sa√∫de](http://www2.insa.pt/) and a set of international background sequences from [GISAID](http://www.epicov.org) ([laboratory acknowledgements](http://whoinfectedwhom.org/gisaid_cov2020_acknowledgement_table.xls))


## Key points
* We estimate a number of key epidemiological parameters for Portugal based on the genetic diversity of these samples alongside a set of closely related sequences from elsewhere which act as a global reservoir.
* In this analysis we estimate a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.90 in Portugal at the start of the epidemic with R(t) falling below 1 around April 8.
* We estimate a high reporting rate in Portugal (above 50%) with a median estimate from the phylodynamic model of 35,595 cases at the beginnning of May compared to 25,524 reported cases at the same time point.





#### This analysis is based on : 
  
* **59 whole genomes** sampled from **within Portugal**
* **43 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **Portugal**
* Samples within Portugal were collected between **2020-03-03** and **2020-05-04**


Duplicate sequences were removed because they may represent infections associated with the same contact-traced transmission chain. Figure 1 shows the distribution of  the sequences analysed over time, including external sequences. 

Reported cases for comparison to our model predictions are taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Portugal). These data are used for comparison purposes and to estimate the reporting rate and do not influence the phylodynamic analysis.

## How many are infected in Portugal?
In this  analysis we estimate **35595 [9810-181514]** median [95%CI] cumulative infections at the time of the the last sample (2020-05-04). At the same time point there were **25524** reported cases. The estimates follow a similar trajectory to the reported cases at a different magnitude.

## How quickly has the epidemic in Portugal grown?

|   2.5%   |        2.18         |         0.121         |         2.75         |
|  97.5%   |        3.97         |         0.252         |         5.75         |
