### Report prepared on 2020-06-08

#### This report uses full genome sequence data for San Diego shared publicly by [The Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) and [Rady Children's Hospital](https://www.rchsd.org/) and a set of international background sequences from [GISAID](http://www.epicov.org) ([laboratory acknowledgements](http://whoinfectedwhom.org/gisaid_cov2020_acknowledgement_table.xls))


## Key points
* We estimate a number of key epidemiological parameters for San Diego based on the genetic diversity of these samples alongside a set of closely related sequences from elsewhere which act as a global reservoir.
* In this  analysis we estimate a basic reproduction number (R0) of 1.91 in San Diego with R falling below 1 by the time of the last available sequence data at the beginning of April.
* We estimate a reporting rate of around 10% in San Diego with a median estimate from the phylodynamic model of 28,960 cases at the end of April compared to 3,432 reported cases at the same time point.


#### This analysis is based on : 
  
* **35 whole genomes** sampled from **within San Diego**
* **51 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **San Diego**
* Samples within San Diego were collected between **2020-03-11** and **2020-04-29**

Duplicate sequences were removed because they may represent infections associated with the same contact-traced transmission chain. Figure 1 shows the distribution of  the sequences analysed over time, including external sequences. 

Reported cases for comparison to our model predictions are taken from [San Diego County](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/Epidemiology/COVID-19%20Bar%20Graph%20of%20New%20and%20Total%20Cases.pdf). These data are used for comparison purposes and to estimate the reporting rate and do not influence the phylodynamic analysis.

## How many are infected in San Diego?
In this  analysis we estimate **28960 [8103-162788]** median [95%CI] cumulative infections at the time of the the last sample (2020-04-29). At the same time point there were **3432** reported cases. The estimates follow a similar trajectory to the reported cases at a different magnitude.
