* This is a preliminary analysis based on a small number of genetic sequences sampled in Kinshasa uploaded to [gisaid](gisaid.org) before 2020-05-30.
* We estimate a number of key epidemiological parameters based on the genetic diversity of these samples alongside a set of closely related sequences from elsewhere which act as a global reservoir.
* We estimate an initial R (R0) of 2.18 which falls to 2.15 [CrI 1.77-2.57] by 2020-04-25. Note the credible interval falls below 2 by this point, suggesting R is decreasing over time. As only a small number of sequences are available it is difficult to estimate changes in R(t) over time and these estimates are likely to change with more sequence data.
* We estimate that approximately 0.01% of the Kinshasa population are infected by date of last sample, 2020-04-25. 

#### This is analysis is based on : 
  
* **89 whole genomes** sampled from **within KS**
* **103 whole genomes** sampled from outside of **KS**
* Samples within KS were collected between **2020-03-11** and **2020-04-25**

These numbers will differ from the number of uploaded sequence on GISAID as we remove sequences with likely sequencing errors or significant gaps. Sequences were deduplicated prior to analyses. Figure 1 shows the distribution of sequences included in analyses over time, including both endogenous (gold) and exogenous sequences (grey) used in the sample. Due to the lack in metadata linked to sequences, there may be some sampling bias in sampling strategies used to collect sequences that we are unaware of (eg. contact tracing, non-random samples in hospitals). This could mean samples are more closely related than would be expected from a random sample in the population and could lead to bias in our estimates.

Using a phylodynamic model we estimate epidemiological parameters by fitting SARS-CoV 2 sequence data from Kinshasa together with a background set of sequences sampled from the larger internationational viral population to the model developed. [The model is explained in detail here](http://whoinfectedwhom.org/seijr0.1.0_methods.pdf). Daily reported confirmed case numbers from Kinshasa for comparison are extracted from [corona-stats mobile](https://corona-stats.mobi/en/DRC/national.php) [and CMR covid-19, the multisectoral comitee in response to COVID-19 pandemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=b34a30571d429859fb249533d&id=7ca2622954).These data are used solely for comparison and as such, do not affect any aspects of the analysis described.

## Estimated infections

In this preliminary analysis, we estimate **11816 [3472-63734]** median [95%CI] cumulative infections at last sample (2020-04-25) by fitting Sars-Cov2 sequence data to our phylogynamic model mentioned prior. The cumulative confirmed infections reported from testing was **429** on the date of last sample. As such, We estimate about **0.01%** of the population of Kinshasa to be infected by the date of our last sample (2020-04-25). 

Figures 2 and 3 show cumulative and daily estimated infections respectively. Towards the end of the curve the increase in daily number infections each day begins to stabilise. This may be due to the shutting of all borders with neighbouring countries on [2020-03-26 and offical lockdown and ceasing of non-essential activities on 2020-04-06 across most of DRC, including Kinshasa](https://www.worldaware.com/covid-19-alert-drc-imposes-lockdown-kinshasha-april-6-20). However, further anlayses are required to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission in this region.
Unfortunately, case reporting data prior to April 5th in Kinshasa is not available at this time. As such, reported number of infections is not included prior to this date.

Figure 4 shows estimates of cumulative reporting rate over time. We estimate reporting rate for Kinshasa over time  by comparing our model estimates to reported case data. These estimates have high uncertainty due to the small number of local sequences used in this analysis. Additionally, case reporting data prior to April 5th in Kinshasa is not available at this time. As such, we are unable to estimate reporting rate at the start of the outbreak.

We estimate the reproduction number to remain relatively stable over time, although we see a extremely small decrease following the introduction of lockdown in Kinshasa. The lower bound of the confidence interval drops below 2 by the date of last sample, suggesting the possibility for R to be decreasing at this point.  We do expect R to decrease following introduction of lockdown in the region, however it is likely we need later sequence data (greater than two weeks following lockdown) to more accuratly estimate the relationship between lockdown and reduction in transmission.

## How quickly has the epidemic in KS grown?

|:--------:|:-------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
|   50%    |        2.18         |         0.120         |         5.77         |
|   2.5%   |        1.81         |        0.0870         |         4.4          |
|  97.5%   |        2.63         |         0.157         |         7.97         |

## How has SARS-CoV 2 evolved in KS?

We present here a time scaled phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 in Kinshasa and the included international reservoir (Figure 6). Kinshasa sequences are relatively well mixed with international sequences, suggesting there is still some cases occuring from new introductions in the community. This is to be expected, as a large number of sequences used in this preliminary analysis are still quite close to first reported case in Kinshasa (2020-03-10) and to when borders were officially closed down in the DRC (2020-03-26). This suggests the sequences used in present analysis may provide a relatively random sample from the population of Kinshasa. However, metadata on sequences collected as well as information on sampling strategies used to collect sequence data is still required to confirm this.
